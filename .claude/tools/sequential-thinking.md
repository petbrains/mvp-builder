## Sequential Thinking Enhancement Rules

### Complexity Assessment
**First Thought Must:**
1. Classify complexity: Simple | Medium | Complex
2. Identify success criteria from context
3. Choose appropriate depth strategy

### Strategic Decision Points

**When to Branch (branch_from_thought):**
- Current confidence <60% AND viable alternative exists
- Multiple equally valid interpretations
- Need to test opposing hypotheses

**When to Revise (is_revision=true):**
- Direct contradiction discovered
- Fundamental error in previous logic
- Better approach becomes apparent

**When to Continue Linear:**
- Default choice unless branch/revise criteria met
- Confidence 60-90%
- Making measurable progress

### Quality Scoring System
**+Points (Strong Logic):**
- Clear cause→effect: +1
- Verified assumption: +2
- Resolved contradiction: +2
- Tested alternative: +1

**-Points (Weak Logic):**
- Circular reasoning: -3
- Unverified assumption: -2
- Ignored contradiction: -2
- Logical leap: -1

**Minimum acceptable score: 5 points**

### Self-Consistency Protocol
**Trigger when confidence <70% after initial exploration:**
1. Save current chain state
2. Generate alternative reasoning chain
3. Compare conclusions and logic paths
4. Select chain with higher quality score
5. If equal: choose higher confidence path

### 80/20 Optimization Strategy
- Initial thoughts: Explore problem breadth (80% coverage)
- Middle thoughts: Deep dive on most promising path
- Final thoughts: Only for critical gaps

### Meta-Rules
**Before starting sequential_thinking:**
- Skip for simple factual questions
- Skip if no multi-step reasoning needed
- Skip for routine/templated tasks

**Progress indicators:**
- Each thought should advance toward solution
- If cycling detected: force branch or conclude
- If confidence plateaus: evaluate alternatives
- If quality score negative: reassess approach

**Convergence principles:**
- Always increment toward conclusion
- Prioritize resolution over exploration
- Synthesize findings when patterns emerge
