# Mobile Standards

Cross-platform rules for native mobile development. Platform-specific APIs (iOS: `ios.md`, Android: forthcoming `android.md`) take precedence for platform-specific concerns.

## Storage Taxonomy

### Storage Categories

| Category | Purpose | Backup | Survives Uninstall | OS Can Purge |
|----------|---------|--------|--------------------|--------------|
| Documents | User-generated irreplaceable data | Yes | No | No |
| Cache | Regeneratable data (API responses, thumbnails) | No | No | Yes |
| Temp | Short-lived intermediate files | No | No | Yes (anytime) |
| Media / Scoped | User photos, videos, downloads | Depends | Configurable | No |
| Secure (Keychain/Keystore) | Credentials, encryption keys | No (by default) | No | No |

### Selection Rules
- User-generated data that cannot be re-downloaded → Documents
- Server-fetched data, derived artifacts, thumbnails → Cache
- Files in active processing only → Temp
- User-authored photos/videos/exports → Media/Scoped with appropriate permissions
- Auth tokens, encryption keys, PII → Secure Storage only

### Non-negotiables
- Never store sensitive data in Cache or Temp
- Never rely on Cache persistence — code must handle cache eviction gracefully
- Never use external/shared storage for app-private data
- Always declare storage intent at write time — don't rely on global defaults

## Secure Storage

### Hierarchy (most to least secure)
1. Hardware-backed secure enclave (StrongBox on Android, Secure Enclave on iOS) — encryption keys only
2. Platform secure store (Keychain on iOS, Keystore + EncryptedSharedPreferences on Android) — tokens, credentials
3. Encrypted database with key from Keystore/Keychain — sensitive structured data
4. Regular storage + field-level encryption — never for secrets alone, only as defense-in-depth

### Non-negotiables
- Never store auth tokens, API keys, or credentials in plain UserDefaults / SharedPreferences
- Never store secrets in app bundle, `Info.plist`, `AndroidManifest.xml`, or source code
- Never log token values, even masked — log presence only (`token: present`)
- Encryption keys live in Keystore/Keychain, never in app memory beyond immediate use
- Biometric-gated decryption for highly sensitive data (payment credentials, health records)

## Network Awareness

### Connection State
- Detect connection type before initiating large transfers (Wi-Fi vs cellular vs no network)
- Respect OS-level data saver mode (Android Data Saver, iOS Low Data Mode)
- Never initiate background data sync on cellular without explicit user opt-in
- Listen for connectivity changes — don't poll network state

### Request Limits
- Batch small requests where possible — HTTP request overhead is significant on cellular
- Apply exponential backoff with jitter for retries — never fixed-interval retry loops
- Never retry indefinitely — cap retries (typically 3–5) and surface failure to user

### Bandwidth Respect
- Use modern image formats (WebP, AVIF, HEIC) where supported
- Request appropriate resolution — never download 4K when rendering at 320px
- Support server-side thumbnail variants — don't downscale client-side after full download

## Background Execution

### Principles
- Treat background time as scarce and revocable — OS can terminate at any moment
- Every background task must be resumable — design for interruption
- Persist progress before suspension — assume app will be killed
- Use platform job scheduling APIs (WorkManager, BackgroundTasks) — never raw threads or timers
- Declare minimum constraints (network type, battery, storage) — let OS optimize execution
- Never block app termination waiting for background work

### Non-negotiables
- Never perform heavy CPU work on the main thread
- Never hold wake locks beyond the minimum required duration
- Never schedule periodic background work more frequent than needed (typical floor: 15 min)
- Respect OS battery optimization / Doze / App Standby — work with it, not around it

## Media Handling

### Upload Strategy
- Files ≤5 MB — single-request upload
- Files >5 MB — chunked / resumable upload: session survives app restart, chunks independently retryable
- Files >50 MB — always chunked, require Wi-Fi by default (user can override)

### Image Caching
- Cache key includes target dimensions and format — never cache original at display size
- Downsample at decode time — never decode full resolution for thumbnail display
- Decode on background thread — never on main thread
- Cancel pending loads when target view is recycled or detached

### Non-negotiables
- Never upload or download large media without progress indication
- Never keep decoded bitmaps beyond display need — decoded memory dominates mobile RAM

## Permissions

### Request Strategy
- Request at point of use, never at app launch
- Provide pre-prompt rationale for non-obvious permissions
- Request minimum necessary scope — coarse location before fine, photo picker before gallery access
- Handle denial gracefully — provide alternative flow or clear explanation of lost functionality
- Never re-prompt after denial without clear user action indicating reconsideration
- Detect auto-reset permissions (unused app hibernation) — re-request on next relevant use

### Delegation Over Permission
Prefer OS-provided pickers that require no permission:
- Photo Picker (iOS 14+, Android Photo Picker) over full gallery access
- Document Picker over storage access
- Share Sheet / Activity over contact access
- System camera intent over direct camera permission

### Non-negotiables
- Never request permissions the app doesn't immediately use
- Never access protected resources on app launch or before user action
- Never treat permission grant as permanent — check status on each access

## App Integrity

- Never ship API keys or secrets in the app binary expecting them to remain secret — treat them as public
- When the backend handles payments or sensitive data: platform attestation APIs (Play Integrity, App Attest), validated server-side

## Privacy

### Data Minimization
- Collect only data directly required for current feature functionality
- Prefer on-device processing over sending raw data to backend (ML inference, analytics aggregation)
- Anonymize or aggregate before transmission where feature allows
- Use resettable pseudo-IDs, not persistent device identifiers

### Sensitive Surfaces
- Mark screens displaying sensitive content to prevent OS app-switcher screenshots
- Hide sensitive fields when app backgrounds
- Never log PII, credentials, tokens, payment details, or health data
- Redact sensitive fields before sending to crash reporters / analytics SDKs

### Retention
- Delete cached data when corresponding server data is deleted
- Provide user-accessible data clearing — app settings must expose "clear cache" and "clear data"
- Honor account deletion — remove all local data on sign-out for sensitive apps

### Third-Party SDKs
- Treat every third-party SDK as a potential data exfiltration path — audit actual traffic, not just docs
- Avoid SDKs that cannot be disabled per-user for GDPR/CCPA opt-out

## Resilience & Offline Behavior

Offline-First Principle and Queue Persistence apply when the spec requires offline usage —
don't impose them on network-only MVPs. State Restoration applies to every app.

### Offline-First Principle
- UI reads from local database as single source of truth — never directly from network
- Writes update local state immediately (optimistic UI), queue for background sync
- Sync engine reconciles with server — decoupled from UI
- Every sync failure has a retry plan — transient errors retry, permanent errors surface to user

### Queue Persistence
- Pending mutations survive app termination — persist queue in database, not memory
- Each queued mutation carries a client-generated idempotency key
- On successful server response, remove from queue — never assume success without ack
- On permanent failure (400-level), revert optimistic UI state and notify user

### State Restoration
- UI state survives process death — save navigation stack, scroll positions, form inputs
- Restore to exact prior state on relaunch — never dump user to home screen
- Never rely on in-memory singletons for user-visible state

## Device & Release Safety

### Device Diversity
- Test on minimum supported OS version — not just latest
- Test on low-memory device class — not just flagship
- Never assume 5G / Wi-Fi network conditions — test throttled network profiles
- Support minimum 2 major OS versions back — typical industry practice

### Release Non-negotiables
- Never ship without crash reporting + symbolication configured
- Assume releases are final — rollback is slow (app store review) and partial (user update behavior)

## Non-negotiable Rules

### Main Thread
- No blocking I/O on main thread — no disk reads, no network, no heavy computation
- No synchronous decoding of images, audio, video on main thread
- No main-thread CoreData / Realm / Room queries beyond trivial reads

### Memory
- Never hold references to Views / ViewControllers / Activities / Fragments beyond their lifecycle
- Release heavy resources on low-memory warnings
- Decoded bitmap memory dominates — size to display, not to source

### Sensitive Output
- Never log auth tokens, API keys, passwords, PII, payment data, health data
- Never include secrets in crash reports or analytics payloads
- Never display sensitive data in exception messages shown to user

### Error Handling
- Every network call has explicit timeout — never rely on OS default (too long)
- Every async operation has cancellation path — tied to UI lifecycle
- Never swallow errors silently — log, surface, or explicitly document why ignored
