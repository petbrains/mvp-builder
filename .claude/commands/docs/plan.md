# Instructions

Generate technical implementation plan by filling plan-template.md based on validated specifications.
Creates minimal supporting artifacts that complement (not duplicate) existing documentation.

**Tools Usage:**
- `Read`: For loading spec.md, ux.md, and existing planning documents
- `Write`: For saving plan artifacts and research notes
- `Bash`: For directory creation and file verification

**Skills:**
- Sequential Thinking Methodology: For complex architectural decisions and multi-step analysis
  - Tool: `/mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking`
- Context7 Documentation Retrieval: For library documentation and compatibility verification
  - Tools: `/mcp__context7__resolve-library-id`, `/mcp__context7__get-library-docs`

**Template:**
- Plan: @.claude/templates/plan-template.md

**Project context:**
- PRD: @ai-docs/PRD.md
- Features list: @ai-docs/FEATURES.md

**File Structure:**
- Input: `./ai-docs/features/[feature]/` (expects spec.md and ux.md)
- Output: 
  - `./ai-docs/features/[feature]/plan.md` (implementation strategy)
  - `./ai-docs/features/[feature]/research.md` (technical research and decisions)
  - `./ai-docs/features/[feature]/data-model.md` (entities)
  - `./ai-docs/features/[feature]/setup.md` (environment setup and configuration)
  - `./ai-docs/features/[feature]/contracts/` (API contracts)

# Task

Transform validated feature specifications into focused technical implementation plan.
Fill plan-template.md with concrete technical decisions while generating MINIMAL supporting artifacts.

# Core Principles

## File Ownership
- **research.md**: WHY decisions were made (including any necessary deviations from PRD approach)
- **data-model.md**: ALL entities, states, validation rules, constants (timeouts, limits, enums)
- **contracts/**: HOW components communicate (transport schemas ONLY)
- **setup.md**: HOW TO install and run
- **plan.md**: HOW TO organize and implement

## Content Guidelines
- Maximum 300 lines per file
- No implementation code, only architecture
- Reference using comments at first mention only: `// from data-model.md`
- Remove all future scope markers and unused fields
- Each word must add value - no boilerplate

## Consistency Rules
- Validation phrasing must match spec.md exactly
- Derived values as formulas: `// base_timeout + increment`
- Constants only in data-model.md
- One code organization structure in plan.md
- When first referencing entity/state types in each contract: add origin comment
- Subsequent references in same contract don't need comments

## Planning Coverage Rules
- All functional requirements from spec.md must have implementation approach
- All UX patterns from ux.md must map to technical components
- Reference existing documentation instead of duplicating

**Technical Context filling:**
- Must align with PRD Technical Requirements section where applicable
- If feature requires deviation from PRD stack, briefly note: "[Component]: [Choice] - [One sentence rationale]"
- Rationale must be feature-specific, not technology-specific

## API Specification Rules
- Use OpenAPI 3.1.0+ for REST API specifications
- Follow latest specification standards for all contract types
- Keep contracts focused on interfaces, not implementation

# Execution Flow

## Phase 0: Context & Research

### 0.1 Initialize Planning
```bash
# Validate required inputs exist
[ ! -f "./ai-docs/features/$FEATURE/spec.md" ] && echo "Error: spec.md not found" && exit 1
[ ! -f "./ai-docs/features/$FEATURE/ux.md" ] && echo "Error: ux.md not found" && exit 1
```

**Load ALL source files once:**
- Read `./ai-docs/features/[feature]/spec.md` → Extract requirements, entities (note existing Key Entities section)
- Read `./ai-docs/features/[feature]/ux.md` → Extract flows, patterns, quantified UX values for constants
- Read `./ai-docs/PRD.md` → Extract technical requirements and architecture
- Read `./ai-docs/FEATURES.md` → Understand feature context and dependencies

**Cross-Feature Entity References:**
- Extract dependency list from FEATURES.md "Depends on:" field (already loaded in context)
- For each dependency folder:
  - Check if ./ai-docs/features/[dependency]/data-model.md exists
  - If exists: reference by path, do not redefine entities
  - If not exists: define minimal interface with required fields and [Dependency] marker
  - [Dependency] marker signals: "Full definition in dependent feature, this is contract only"

**Keep in context throughout execution**

### 0.2 Load References
```bash
# Load supplementary materials if available
if [ -d "./ai-docs/references" ] && [ "$(ls -A ./ai-docs/references 2>/dev/null)" ]; then
    echo "Loading references..."
fi
```
- If references directory contains files: Read all files into context
- Keep in context throughout planning

### 0.3 Execute Research & Document

**Extract dependencies from spec.md and ux.md:**
- Identify mentioned libraries, frameworks, packages
- Note technology stack references  
- Verify alignment with PRD architecture choices

**Apply Sequential Thinking Methodology** for research analysis:
- Analyze feature dependencies from extracted libraries
- Evaluate compatibility with PRD stack
- Identify integration risks
- Select optimal versions
- Document critical decisions

**Apply Context7 Documentation Retrieval** for each identified library:
- Resolve library ID (trust score ≥7 preferred)
- Fetch documentation with feature-specific topic
- Use 20000 tokens for comprehensive coverage

If no external libraries identified, skip library documentation step.

**Create concise research.md:**
```markdown
# Research Notes - [Feature Name]

## Key Decisions (essential points only, typically 3-7)
- **[Decision]**: [What chosen] - [Brief why, 1 sentence]

## Critical Risks
- **[Risk]**: [Impact] → [Mitigation]

## Stack Compatibility
- [Verified combination]: ✔
```

NO alternatives, NO lengthy explanations, NO rejected approaches.
NO configuration details (those go in `setup.md`).
NO implementation details (those go in `plan.md`).

**Write research artifact:**
- Write `./ai-docs/features/[feature]/research.md`

## Phase 1: Design Artifacts

### 1.1 Generate Data Model
**Analyze entities from spec.md (already in context):**
- Extract directly from Key Entities section
- Define field types and constraints based on requirements
- Map relationships and cardinality
- Identify state transitions from ux.md flows
- Extract validation rules from spec.md requirements
- Extract quantified values from ux.md Quantified UX Elements for constants

**Type Completeness Rule:**
- Every type referenced in entity fields MUST be defined in data-model.md
- If field type is complex (not primitive), define as separate entity or type alias
- Primitives: string, number, boolean, timestamp, array of primitives
- Referenced but undefined types block downstream generation

**Create data-model.md with technical specs:**
```markdown
# Data Model - [Feature Name]

## Entities
[For each entity from spec.md add:
- Field types and constraints (required/optional, length limits)
- System fields (unique identifier, timestamps)
- Default values and computed fields]

## Enums
[All enumerated types used in entities:
- Enum name with values
- Brief description of each value if not self-evident]

## States & Transitions
[State machine if applicable:
- State diagram or transition table
- Triggers, conditions, side effects
- Timeouts if any]

## Constants
[All numeric values: timeouts, limits, thresholds
- Include values from ux.md Quantified UX Elements
- Use formulas for derived values: // BASE_TIMEOUT + INCREMENT
- For thresholds: specify comparison operator in description (< or <=, > or >=)
- Reference source: (FR-XXX), (UX-XXX), (ux.md), (PRD constraint)]

## Validation Rules
[Field-level and entity-level validations:
- Format patterns, length limits, ranges
- Cross-field validations
- Business rule validations]
```

NO code, NO SQL, NO platform-specific types.
Abstract technical specifications that apply to any implementation.

**Write data model artifact:**
- Write `./ai-docs/features/[feature]/data-model.md`

### 1.2 Generate API Contracts (if needed)
**Create contracts based on feature interfaces:**

Create `./ai-docs/features/[feature]/contracts/`:
- Write `./ai-docs/features/[feature]/contracts/openapi.yaml` - For REST API endpoints
- Write `./ai-docs/features/[feature]/contracts/contracts.md` - For messaging, events, WebSocket, storage schemas

Feature may require BOTH files if it uses multiple interface types

**Content guidelines:**
- Message/event contracts: type names and message structure only
- Storage contracts: reference to entity type, not field expansion
- API contracts: field names, primitive types, and structural constraints
  - Structural constraints (INCLUDE): required fields, enum values, array minItems/maxItems
  - Validation constraints (EXCLUDE): string length, numeric ranges, regex patterns — those belong in data-model.md
- First reference to entity/state types: add origin comment
- Subsequent references in same contract: no comment needed

**Contract type determination:**
- External communication interfaces → formal specification required
- Internal messaging between components → message schema documentation
- Event-based communication → event structure documentation
- If no external interfaces exist → skip formal specification creation

### 1.3 Create Setup Guide
**Generate setup.md:**
```markdown
# Setup - [Feature Name]

## Install
[Installation commands for dependencies]

## Config
[Key configuration needed for this feature]

## Run
[Commands to start development]

## Test
[Commands to run automated tests for TDD workflow]
```

Brief setup instructions only - TDD test commands, no lengthy configs.
NO architecture explanations (those are in plan.md).
NO justifications for dependencies (those are in research.md).

**Write setup artifact:**
- Write `./ai-docs/features/[feature]/setup.md`

## Phase 2: Implementation Plan

**Use already generated artifacts from context:**
- Continue with research.md, data-model.md, setup.md, contracts/ in memory
- No re-reading needed as content is already in context

**Apply Sequential Thinking Methodology** for planning synthesis:
- Synthesize sources (PRD, spec, ux, FEATURES)
- Integrate research decisions from research.md
- Incorporate entity model from data-model.md
- Include setup from setup.md and contracts from contracts/
- Map to plan-template sections
- Select optimal code organization
- Define component architecture

### Fill Template Sections

**Consistency validation before writing:**
- Cross-check validation rules against spec.md exact phrasing
- Verify all FR-XXX requirements have implementation approach
- Ensure all UX-XXX requirements map to components
- Check entity naming consistency across all artifacts
- Verify storage approach aligns with spec.md requirements
- Ensure no constants are hardcoded (reference data-model.md)
- Check derived values use formula comments
- Verify all referenced types are defined in data-model.md

**Purpose & Summary:**
- 1-2 sentences max each
- Reference research.md for details

**Technical Context:**
- Brief bullets only
- State what is used, not why (why is in research.md)
- Reference specific technology decisions from research.md
- **Storage:** Specify primary storage + any secondary storage with clear use case separation
  - Example: "PostgreSQL for entities, Redis for cache, IndexedDB for offline support"

**Implementation Mapping:**
- How requirements → components (don't repeat requirements)
- How errors → handling (don't repeat error types)
- Component names should reflect feature purpose

**Testing Approach:**
- Test-first development workflow
- Unit test structure matching code organization
- Integration test scenarios from acceptance criteria
- NO manual test checklists

**Select Feature Code Organization:**
- Choose ONE structure (A, B, C, or D) from template
- Remove all other structures and their "Structure X:" prefixes
- Keep only selected structure with its rationale
- Document brief rationale for selection
- **Selected Structure:** [Structure letter] ([Structure name]) - [One sentence rationale specific to this feature's requirements]
  - Rationale must reference specific requirements, not generic benefits

**Implementation Notes:**
- Document critical implementation decisions, trade-offs, or considerations
- **Edge case handling:** Document approach for spec.md edge cases. If not all covered, note which require future iteration with rationale
- **Scalability notes:** If feature may hit limits (data size, API rate, etc.), document threshold and mitigation strategy

**Write plan.md:**
- Write `./ai-docs/features/[feature]/plan.md`
- Exclude Review Checklist from output

## Phase 3: Validate & Report

Internal validation using template's Review Checklist (mental check only):
- Requirements coverage
- No duplication
- Consistency across files
- Single code organization selected
- All referenced types defined in data-model.md
- All thresholds have comparison operators specified
- All constants from ux.md Quantified UX Elements included
- Cross-feature dependencies properly handled

**Final output:**
```
Implementation Planning Complete!

Feature: [feature-name]
Generated:
- plan.md (implementation strategy)
- research.md (key decisions)
- data-model.md (entities)
- setup.md (setup commands)
- contracts/ (if API needed)

Next: /docs:tasks <feature-path>
```
